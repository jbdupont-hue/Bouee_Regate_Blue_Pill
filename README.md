This project is a continuation of a work in progress which goal is to create regatta sailing buoys to be used for radio sailing training sessions.
The objective is to avoid the need of a boat to lay and to recup buoys for training sessions or regatta.
The buoy remains to the position the user pilot them to using a radio control transmitter.
The buoy can handle calm weather, some current/wind, or strong current/wind (three position switch)
The buoy can be calibrated for its compass and for its gyroscope (three position switch).
The magnetic declination is hard coded for the Parisian area and need be adapted for other locations
The base component is a STM32F103C8T6 blue-pill micro-controler programmed in C++
The overall idea is to bring costs down from an Ardupilot type of buoy which works great but are costing quite a faire amount of money...
This implementation enables to cut cost by half.
